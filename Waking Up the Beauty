Wake up. 
You have a surprise. 
It's shining, 
shining,
shining,
and well, shining.

So, what?

You see a beauty in the sky. 
So what? 
A beauty in your eyes.
So what?
Look in the mirror. 
This is what. 

Surprise is that you can see it,
surprise is that you will never saw it sun shine like this ever, 
and will never see it shine like this ever again.
